Product Search: Facilitates searching for products based on various criteria (e.g., name, category, price).
Inventory Management
Stock Management: Tracks the quantity of each product in stock and alerts users when stock levels are low.
Purchase Orders: Generates purchase orders for suppliers to replenish inventory.
Expiry Tracking: Monitors product expiration dates and provides notifications for products nearing their expiration.
Customer Management
